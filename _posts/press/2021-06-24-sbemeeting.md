I had the opportunity to discuss a bit about how the interpretation of phenotypes (the physical manifestation of genetic information) is very important in studies using genomic data at the [II SBE Meeting](https://www.sbemeeting.com/). I participated in the "Phenotype still matters in the genomic era" [symposium](https://www.sbemeeting.com/symposia) among fantastic and diverse colleagues and research. Can't wait for next year's meeting! 

Link for the talk will be available soon.
