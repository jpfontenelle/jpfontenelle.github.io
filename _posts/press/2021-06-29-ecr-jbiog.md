[Journal of Biogeography](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/13652699) has written an Early Career Researcher (ECR) feature on our work about the evolution and biogeography of the Neotropical freshwater stingrays that has been published in the same [journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.14086). I talk a bit about the research, the process behind it, motivation and hypotheses, as well as future goals for this and other lines of study.
