We have just published the most complete molecular phylogeny for the subfamily Potamotrygoninae in the [Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.](https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean)

Our research highlights the taxonomic difficulties of the Neotropical freshwater stingrays, and we discuss the incongruencies between morphology and molecular taxonomy and systematics of this group.

We identify instances of cryptic diversity, possible morphological converge and molecular introgression between lineages of _Potamotrygon_. 

Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings from a conservation perspective.
