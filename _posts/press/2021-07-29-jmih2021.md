I was very delighted to participate in the 2021 Joint Meeting of Ichthyology and Herpetology (JMIH) organized by the American Society of Ichthyology and Herpetology (ASIH) this past week. Unfortunately I was not able to attend it in person this year, but had the opportunity to present our research on the phylogenics of Potamotrygoninae virtually. It is always a great meeting, and I am very happy that I could share results of my research with so many friends and colleages.

Not only that, I had the honor of being part of two other great studies presented at the same meeting. Victor de Britto ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/victor_debrito)) presented his brilliant study on body size correlations to habitat transitions between marine and freshwater environments; and Taegan Perez([Twitter](https://twitter.com/peres_taegan)) gave a really nice talk in her first JMIH about the importance of integrative approaches in biological surveys and conservation implications in Costa Rica.
