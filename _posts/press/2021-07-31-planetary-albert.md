To cap the month of July, our publication in the [Global and Planetary Change](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/global-and-planetary-change) journal came out!

This great study lead my my colleague and co-author [Dr. James Albert](https://biology.louisiana.edu/james-albert) uses empirical data from fish distribution allied with geological data from the literature, as well as other distribution data from different organisms in the Amazon, to discuss how Late Neogene river captures are responsible for the distribution patterns we see today.

We discuss how these geological events and the modern channelization of the Amazon and Orinoco have impacted in the distribution patterns seen today.

It was a great experience and I am honored to be part of this great contribution to the field, published in this excellent special volume organized by [Dr. Carina Hoorn](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/h/o/m.c.hoorn2/m.c.hoorn.html?cb)
