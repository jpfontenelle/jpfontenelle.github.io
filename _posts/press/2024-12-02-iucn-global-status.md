Glad to announce that the most recent update of the IUCN "Global Status of Sharks, Rays and Chimaeras" volume is available at the [IUCN website](https://www.iucnssg.org/-the-global-status-of-sharks-rays-and-chimaeras.html).

This compilation is a major effort of many authorities around the world on the most up-to-date trends and conservation status for major groups of elasmobranchs across the globe.

Not only this volume includes a break down per areas around the globe, but also for particular groups of interest.

I am proud to be part of this initiative with many inspiring collaborators. We have published the chapter "river jewels" regarding the diversity, ecology and conservation status of the Neotropical freshwater  stingrays (Potamotrygoninae).

You can find this chapter (and all the other ones for this volume) [here](https://doi.org/10.59216/ssg.gsrsrc.2024)!
